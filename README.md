***Simon Says Game***

This is a small interactive "Simon Says" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests your memory by presenting a sequence of colors that you must replicate. As you progress, the sequences become longer and more challenging.  

**Features:**  
- Visually appealing interface with vibrant colors.  
- Dynamic sequence generation and validation.  
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.  

This project demonstrates front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic implementation.
